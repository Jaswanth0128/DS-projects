#üöÄ Capstone Project: Data Cleaning and Analysis

In my recent capstone project, I tackled a real-world business scenario involving product data and customer details. Leveraging my skills in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, I accomplished the following key tasks:

#Data Cleaning:

Removed duplicate rows from the product table.
Filtered out invalid data and organized it into a new sheet.
Fixed formatting issues (such as comma-hyphen) in the manufacturer column using the ‚ÄúFind and Replace‚Äù technique.
Imputed missing product names from product descriptions using Flash Fill.
Extracted customer segmentation information from customer details using VLOOKUP.
Ensured error-free VLOOKUP by using absolute references.
Converted formulas to values (Paste Special).
Highlighted unknown values in red using conditional formatting.
Standardized the revenue column by replacing the dollar sign.

#Data Analysis with Pivot Tables:

Analyzed unit sales and revenue by product name and category.
Calculated the percentage contribution of each product to overall sales and revenue.
Identified the top 10 manufacturers based on unit sales and revenue.
Explored monthly trends in unit sales and revenue using pivot tables.
Estimated average warranty claims by product name.
Assessed customer satisfaction by product name and manufacturer.
Determined the contribution of different customer segments.

#MySQL Queries:

Fetched all product and customer data from the database.
Extracted product names and corresponding revenue.
Isolated records related to the ‚ÄúEcoTech Green‚Äù product.
Filtered records where revenue exceeded $5000.
Sorted records with revenue greater than $5000 in ascending order.
Calculated the total revenue by product name.
Aggregated revenue statistics (sum, count, and average) by product name.
Segmented data based on customer segmentation.

This project allowed me to apply my analytical skills, enhance my SQL proficiency, and gain valuable insights for business decision-making.
